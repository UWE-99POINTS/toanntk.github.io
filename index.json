	"content": "RDS - Relational Database Service is a service that helps users create and manage Relational Databases (SQL in relational form).\nKey Features\nIt is a DaaS (Database as a Service). Allows users to create either a database instance or a cluster of instances. It can scale in two ways: Vertical Scaling: Increase or decrease the instance configuration. Horizontal Scaling: Add or remove nodes, but these nodes can only be read replicas. There is a maximum limit on the hard drive capacity (64 TB for MySQL, MariaDB, etc., and 16 TB for Microsoft SQL). Basic Features\nQuickly create basic DB instances or clusters. Automatic failover between master-slave instances in case of incidents. High Availability: Automatically configures standby instances, users only need to select. Scalability in terms of storage capacity. Automated backups. Adjust settings at the Database level using Parameter Groups. "

You might use Cloud9 to develop and test applications that connect to your RDS database.\nRDS (Relational Database Service): The primary focus of the lab is on RDS.

This approach offers several benefits:\nZero Downtime Deployment: Blue-Green deployments allow you to switch from the current environment to the new one without any downtime. You can direct traffic to the green environment while keeping the blue one running, and then switch back if any issues arise.\nQuick Rollback: If there are problems with the green environment, you can quickly switch back to the blue one, ensuring minimal disruption to users.\nTesting: You can thoroughly test the green environment before directing real traffic to it. This ensures that your new version is stable and performs as expected.\nReduced Risk: Blue-Green deployments reduce the risk of introducing issues into the production environment since you can validate the green environment before making it live.\nScalability Testing: You can also use the green environment to test scalability and performance under real traffic conditions before promoting it to production.\nConsistency: It helps maintain consistency between environments, as the green environment is identical to the blue one except for the changes you intend to deploy.\nIsolation: The blue and green environments are isolated from each other, reducing the chances of conflicts or interference between old and new code.\nSelect Actions Chose Create Blue/Green Deployment - new Add name to Blue/Green Indentifier : rds-mysql-lab Chose engine version for Blue/Green setting : MYSQL-8.0.34-recommended Click Create Staging enviroment The creation process can take anywhere from 25 to 30 minutes.
